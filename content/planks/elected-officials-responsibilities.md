updated: "**It is the responsibility of an elected official, who holds and casts any vote, to honor their oath and do so with the utmost understanding of the consequences. Their power to vote on behalf of their constituents has been given with the highest fidelity, and proactive input on specific legislation or ordinances from constituents should be equal to or greater than other stakeholders. The default vote should always be a “No” vote. To move from a “No” vote to a “Yes” vote should be difficult and require fully reading the proposed legislation, with a clear case that the citizenry who entrusted them will benefit–and not lobbyists or special interests. It is the responsibility of a legislator to only propose and vote on single subject–and not single category–bills. Legislators should sponsor and floor sponsor as few bills as possible and should fully understand those bills. If a vote was taken in error, it is the responsibility of the elected official to correct the error and continue efforts to right the wrong until rectified. A vote in favor of legislation is tantamount to entering into a contract on your constituents behalf. Elected officials should continue their education in the principles outlined in our founding documents. Accessibility, coordination, and communication with Party leadership is both the responsibility of Party leadership and any representatives that represent constituents in all or part of Utah County. (Utah Constitution: Article VI, Sections 22, Article VIII, Section 2)**"
