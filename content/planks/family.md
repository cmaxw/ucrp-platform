original: "The family is the fundamental unit of a healthy society. Parents have the right to bear children (or otherwise add children to their families), to determine their own family size, and to determine what is in their best interest without interference from government. We encourage all efforts to strengthen the moral character of our children and oppose policies, practices, and public expressions that degrade humanity and the sanctity of family relationships. We oppose efforts to include sexual orientation as a protected class. Although outliers occur and outcomes vary, traditional roles are the societal ideal in the rearing of children. (U.S. Constitution: Preamble. Utah Constitution: Article I, Section 1)"
