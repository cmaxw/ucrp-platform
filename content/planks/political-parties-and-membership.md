Political Parties have the right to hold their own primaries and determine their own method of electing nominees for the general ballot. The right to regulate and control membership and the use of the 'R' or 'Rep' lies with the Party and not the individual. The UCRP platform, constitution, and bylaws are the governing documents. The Utah County Republican Party has the right to possess, manage, and control its full member data. The Utah County Republican Party can remove members from the Party for cause. As per the United States Supreme Court's rulings, government holds no authority in running the internal functions or processes of a private Party. (Bill of Rights: 1st Amendment. Utah Constitution: Article I, Sections 1 & 7)"
