original: "All government officials are accountable to the people and must be receptive to petitions of redress. Any government agency or entity that receives public funds must be open to public audit and review. All levels of government should fully and swiftly comply with citizens’ requests for information (GRAMA and FOIA). Elected officials are accountable for all taxpayer money and must not delegate appropriation authority to non-elected or appointed entities. Deferments, RDAs, special interest rates, etc. are forms of governmental favoritism. Bodies, including public-private partnerships, quasi-governmental entities, Authority Districts, Independent Entities, or any districts/committees made up of elected officials and corporations, being given power over and use of government funds without having all voting members directly elected are in violation of accountable government and the Utah State Constitution. (Bill of Rights: 1st Amendment. Utah Constitution: Article I, Section 2; Article V, Section 1; Article VI, Sections 1 & 28; Article XIII)"
