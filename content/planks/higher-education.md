original: "Higher education institutions should be self-sufficient and provide degrees of value that enrich the community. Any school receiving taxpayer funds must not promote agendas contrary to our Constitutional Republic. Government has no place in scaling credentialing programs or certifications. All educational certificates and higher education degrees should be kept under the jurisdiction of the educational institution. Any centralized, government or affiliated program that requires certification or credentialing–one time or ongoing–is inappropriate and prohibited. (Utah Constitution: Article X, Sections 1,2,3 & 4)"
