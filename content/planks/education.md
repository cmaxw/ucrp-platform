original: "A well-educated and informed citizenry is essential to the long-term well-being of a free society. The primary responsibility for education rests with the student and the family. Parents have the right to choose whether a child is educated in private, public, or home schools, and government must not infringe on that right. To promote excellence, consumer choice in education should be encouraged. Schools or other government entities should not invade the privacy of parents or their children. We favor local accountability and control in all aspects of the education system. Public schools should abstain from teaching promiscuity, favoring any group over another, or providing pornography in any form. Public education’s sole imperative is to educate. Social and welfare functions are not the responsibility of the education system. Any educational ideology that is subversive or destructive to our Constitutional Republic must be ended immediately. (Utah Constitution: Article I, Section 3; Article X, Sections 1,2,3 & 8. Utah Code 53G-6-803: Parental Rights)"
