original: "The Party supports needed legislation to ensure the integrity of the voter registration rolls and to reduce voter fraud. We believe that in-person voting, with voter identification, clear regulations for chain of custody, and verifiability is best and instills the most public confidence. Accommodations for alternate paths or early voting for military, disabled, or religious missions should remain to these select groups with extenuating circumstances. Voting is how peaceful societies transfer power. Election jurisdiction should remain closest to the people. Municipal elections must remain under the jurisdiction of the local municipalities. All other elections should remain under the jurisdiction of the elected county clerk. (Utah Constitution: Article I, Sections 1 & 17; Article IV, Sections 3 & 8)"
