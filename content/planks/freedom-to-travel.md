updated: "**The right to travel freely–unencumbered by government regulation, tracking or reporting–is the right of every individual. Vaccination status should never prohibit the right to travel. Government, public-private partnerships, or non-governmental organizations do not have the authority to control the ability to travel or to limit modes of transportation. Vintage vehicles, gas-powered vehicles, natural gas, or other energy source vehicles are never to be prohibited. Roads and their usage are the property of all citizens and equal access to their use shall not be infringed. Public spaces for traveling and parking, in general, should not be sold to private entities or held in public-private partnerships. (Bill of Rights:10th Amendment. Utah Constitution: Article 1, Sections 1 & 7)**"
