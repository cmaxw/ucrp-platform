original: "The primary defense against crime is stable and responsible family life emphasizing personal accountability and respect for the law. Swift and certain punishments with just and appropriate penalties are essential deterrents to crime. Prosecution of political enemies or excessive punishments due to the political nature of a crime should never occur. For first time, nonviolent offenders, alternatives to incarceration provide cost-effective solutions that uphold personal responsibility using limited government intervention. Post incarceration; families, friends, and communities that support reintegration help to reduce recidivism. (Utah Constitution: Article I, Sections 1, 7, 8 & 12)"
