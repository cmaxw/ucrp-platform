original: "We support an immigration system that is safe, orderly and humane, and protects our national security. We support the Constitutional mandate for the federal government to protect and secure our national borders from illegal immigration and enforce current immigration laws. We oppose the use of taxpayer funds to provide benefits for illegal immigrants. All immigration should be for the benefit and well-being of the citizenry. We also welcome immigrants who enter America through legal avenues. America is a stronger and better nation because of immigrants’ hard work, entrepreneurial spirit, pursuit of the American Dream, and support of our Constitutional Republic. (U.S. Constitution: Article IV, Section 4. Utah Constitution: Article 1, Section 3)"
