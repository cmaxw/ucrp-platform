original: "Each individual is entitled to a trial by jury in both criminal and civil cases. It is the duty of juries to rule on the law as well as the facts of a case. We call upon the judiciary to reestablish this process and to inform juries of this duty. State senators must hold thorough hearings for all judicial nominees, and members of the Judiciary should undergo regular reviews. The results of such reviews should be a matter of public record. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of human life. Judges should not make statute but apply it. (Utah Constitution: Article I, Sections 10 & 12)"
