original: "Taxation should be as fair, equitable, simple, and minimal as possible. Limited government dictates that taxpayers should keep the majority of their money instead of giving it to government. Direct taxation should be avoided, and taxation without representation is prohibited. Utah’s system of taxation has improved and government should continue to refine and improve it. Appropriate tax policy is essential if Utah is to compete globally. Property and estate taxes are an assault on the American Dream and should be eliminated and individuals should be able to own, and/or pass to their heirs, their property without the threat of tax debt confiscation. Property liens should be prohibited for unrelated debt, and never for medical debt. (Utah Constitution: Article I, Sections 1,2,7 & 22; Article XIII, Sections 2 & 3)"
